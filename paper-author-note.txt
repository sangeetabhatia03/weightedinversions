Paper:

Library of relations, heuristic weight reduction algorithm that reaches a local minimum.

Novelty: Cayley graph approach and group relations.  Starting with an existing path and reducing its weight.

Conjecture: it reaches the global minimum.

Test: using another graph tool with weighted path-length.  Extremities of weightings: 2-inversion weight (-> Coxeter length) and uniform weights (GRIMM).
